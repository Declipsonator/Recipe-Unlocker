# Recipe Unlocker
[Curseforge](https://oke.io/Px7cCzK)\

Everyone hates it when you forget how to craft something and you haven\'t unlocked it in the crafting table recipes yet. It always leads to googling \"How to craft ### in Minecraft\". This mod fixes that by showing every single recipe. Recipe Unlocker is client-side mod that even works while on servers (Get Permission First though üòâ).

### Info
‚ö†Ô∏èThis is a **Fabric** only mod and there are no plans to make a forge version.
